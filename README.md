- `random_undersampling.py` is used with the initial unbalaned dataset available on kaggle. This is what normalizes the data for model training.
- `progress_update2.py` is the notebook used for testing 6 model types. This is launched using the CAP4770 docker instance with Jupyter notebook.
- `7_models_with_tuning.py` is a script with detailed comments where the subsequent training occurred. It outputs the results in json format and the models with .joblib extension for testing with the next script:
- `reintroduce_unbalanced_dataset.py` tests the models produced by the previous script against the original dataset
- `compare_model_results.py` loads in the json results from the balanced and unbalanced datasets and produces figures to compare the results.
- `visualize_tuning_effects.py` utilizes the json output during the model training to generate figures that show the impact parameter tuning had on prediction accuracy.
